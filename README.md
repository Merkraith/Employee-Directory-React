## Application

-Run application from [Employee Directory React](https://audijej.github.io/Employee-Directory-React/)

## Usage

The user can use the application by simply navigating to the heroku link. From there the user is presented with the default index page that has a list of employees from the directory. They can simply start searching for an employee in the search bar. Upon typing in the search bar, the application will continuously update the employee list with the given input from the user. The user also has the ability to sort the employee ilst to ascending order. This is done by simply clicking the "name" button at name table column. Once sorted in ascending order, the user still has the ability to utilize the search bar to find any employee.
